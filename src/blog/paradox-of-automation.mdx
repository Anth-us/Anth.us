In 1770, an intriguing invention captivated the world: the Mechanical Turk, created by Wolfgang von Kempelen.  The automaton was a life-sized figure dressed in Ottoman robes, with a turban and a pipe in its mouth, that appeared to be a marvel of automation.<Citation

/>  It played chess against humans and won most of the time.  However, the real magic was not in gears or levers but in the human chess master concealed within.  Kempelen designed the machine so <mark>a person could fit inside the box</mark> and control the Mechanical Turk's arms and hands.  They could see the board through a system of mirrors and use a series of levers to control the arms and hands of the Turk to make its moves.  It was so convincing that many people thought the machine could actually play chess on its own.  Additionally, the audience could chat with the machine using a peg board to spell out messages, which the concealed human could then respond to by moving the Turk's head to indicate "yes" or "no."  The Mechanical Turk was a sensation during its time, inspiring many other inventors to create similar automata.

## Fear of automation dawns

The Mechanical Turk, a marvel of the late 18th century, fascinated audiences without sparking fears of job loss, despite its presentation as an automated chess player.

The arrival of the 19th century witnessed a stark contrast in the public's reaction to technological advancement with the rise of the Luddites. Named after the possibly mythical Ned Ludd, the Luddites were groups of English textile workers who destroyed weaving machinery as a form of protest.<Citation

/> They were not inherently against technology itself, but rather against the economic system that used these machines to undermine their livelihoods. Their actions were born out of desperation, a response to the perceived threat of destitution in an era where upskilling was not a viable option for many. The Luddite movement highlighted the deep societal apprehensions about the displacement of skilled labor by machines, an anxiety that resonated through the working classes.

The Luddites' movement during the early 19th century was a significant, though not isolated, response to the broader upheavals of the Industrial Revolution. This period marked a profound transformation in manufacturing, driven by mechanization and mass production. Factories replaced artisan workshops, fundamentally altering the labor landscape. As machines began to perform tasks previously done by skilled craftsmen, many workers found their livelihoods threatened. This fear was not unfounded, as the rapid pace of industrialization often outstripped the capacity of economies to absorb displaced workers into new industries.

The Luddites' protests were an early manifestation of the fears associated with automation â€” fears that would resurface and evolve over the centuries. Their struggle was emblematic of a broader conflict: the human cost of progress in a rapidly industrializing world, and increasing awareness of the redistribution of wealth associated with automation.  Progress has winners and losers.  It was a stark reminder that <mark>the benefits of technological advancements are not universally distributed</mark> and that economic systems often determine who benefits and who bears the cost. This historical perspective sets the stage for the 20th-century economic theories of Keynes and Schumpeter, who delved deeper into the complexities of technological progress and its impact on employment.

## Two schools of thought on jobs and automation

In the 20th century, the discourse on automation and employment took a more analytical turn with John Maynard Keynes' essay "Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren" (1930).<Citation

/> Keynes introduced the concept of "technological unemployment," expressing concern over the potential of technology to displace human labor across various industries. His theory delved into the societal and economic ramifications of such a shift, contemplating a future where the traditional role of work in human life could be significantly diminished.

In response to Keynes' apprehension, Joseph Schumpeter presented a contrasting viewpoint in his 1942 work, "Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy."<Citation

  }}
/> Schumpeter's theory of 'creative destruction' painted technological advancements as a vital component of economic progress. He argued that while technology inevitably phases out certain industries and job roles, it simultaneously catalyzes the creation of new markets and employment opportunities. For Schumpeter, each advancement in technology was not just a disruptor but a <mark>driver of economic evolution</mark>, fostering innovation and efficiency.

## Does automation create even *more* work?

The fascination with the Mechanical Turk was devoid of fears about job replacement. Interestingly, even if the Mechanical Turk really had worked, it wouldn't have reduced the number of jobs in the chess industry by eliminating human players.  It <mark>would have created even more jobs than it replaced</mark> since nobody would be able to operate one without a professional operator, who would need support from installers, maintainers, and craftspeople.

This mirrors a critical insight from cognitive psychologist Lisanne Bainbridge's 1983 paper "The Ironies of Automation": automation often doesn't reduce the amount human effort overall; sometimes it <mark>creates more responsibilities for humans</mark> that are <mark>even more complex</mark>.<Citation

/>

Bainbridge's research showed that as systems become more automated, the human role shifts from manual operation to system monitoring and management. In essence, while certain tasks are automated, new, often more complex tasks emerge for humans.  She pointed out that each new solution creates new problems, including automating away work.  And that solving these new problems requires <mark>even greater ingenuity than the original work</mark>.  The march of progress creates increasingly complex work, even as it eliminates simple work.

Consider the case of Tesla's Autopilot system, a contemporary example that encapsulates Bainbridge's 1975 observations. This advanced driver-assistance system, while automating many aspects of driving, doesn't fully replace the driver.  Instead, it alters the driver's role, requiring continuous monitoring and readiness to take control. Paradoxically, this can increase the driver's cognitive load, as they must stay alert and prepared to intervene at any moment. You're still responsible for not crashing the Tesla.  You still have to pay attention.  And now, instead of just driving, you have to also supervise an AI and make decisions about when to take control.  Which is <mark>more complicated than just driving the car</mark>.

This irony of automation, where the tool designed to ease a task changes it in unexpected ways, highlights the evolving nature of human interaction with automated systems.

## Modern technological shifts in employment

The story of job transformation in the wake of automation is nowhere more evident than in the case of telephone switchboard operators. Once central to communication, these operators saw their roles become obsolete with the advent of automated switching. Yet, this was not the end of their story. The telecommunications industry absorbed these workers into new, often more lucrative and satisfying roles like customer service, technical support, and network management. This transition resulted in not just the preservation but the expansion of employment in the sector. More importantly, these new roles often offered <mark>higher pay</mark>, increased creative satisfaction, and a chance to develop advanced technical skills. The industry's growth post-automation led to a net increase in jobs, illustrating how technological advancement can lead to unexpected employment opportunities.

In banking, the introduction of ATMs in the latter half of the 20th century presents a similar paradox. While many feared that ATMs would lead to widespread job cuts for bank tellers, the reality unfolded differently. The efficiencies brought by these machines enabled banks to open more branches, particularly in rural and underserved areas, where banking services were much needed. This expansion did not result in fewer teller jobs; instead, it <mark>created more</mark>. The nature of these roles also evolved from simple cash transactions to involve customer relations, financial advice, and sales, offering a more diverse and engaging work experience. This scenario in banking is a prime example of how automation, contrary to diminishing employment opportunities, can catalyze job creation and economic development in new areas.

## Postmodern technological shifts in employment

We all know how this looks now.  According to a report from ResumeBuilder, 37% of business leaders stated that AI replaced workers in 2023, and 4 in 10 predict layoffs due to AI efficiency in 2024.<Citation

/>  Accoring to Asana's report on AI in the workplace, employees believe that 29% of their work tasks are replaceable by AI.<Citation
  data={{
    type: "webpage",
    "container-title": "Asana",

  }}
/>  And they're probably underestimating.  We all can see that something big is coming.

But automating work doesn't mean less work for people.  It can lead to more diverse kinds of jobs that are more satisfying, and it can lead to more jobs overall.  The World Economic Forum's "The Future of Jobs Report 2020" estimated that AI could replace 85 million jobs worldwide by 2025 but also create 97 million new jobs in the same timeframe.<Citation

## Don't think you're immune

In the past, automation hurt jobs the most in sectors reliant on routine and manual tasksâ€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹.  The Brookings Institution has conducted several studies that challenge the assumption that only low-skilled, blue-collar jobs are at risk from AI. They argue that AI's impact on the labor market is more nuanced and widespread, affecting a variety of occupations, including those traditionally considered white-collar or high-skilled.

In one study researchers highlighted the potential for job displacement across a wide range of occupations due to advancements in Large Language Model-based systems (LLMs) like ChatGPT. This includes roles such as software developers and screenwriters, which are typically considered high-skilled, white-collar jobs.<Citation

/>  But now, software developers seem like archaic gatekeepers to app functionality, in a world where you <a href="/blog/the-rise-of-single-use-software/">don't need an app to solve problems</a>.

Another study, used a novel technique to analyze the overlap between AI-related patents and job descriptions. The findings suggest that AI will significantly impact the work lives of relatively well-paid managers, supervisors, and analysts.<Citation

/>  And if you know any attorneys, advertisers, or radiologists, then you know people who are anxious about upskilling and pivoting careers.

This contemporary narrative of AI mirrors the past fears and adaptations seen during the Industrial Revolution. Just as society adapted to the sweeping changes of industrialization, creating new job opportunities and roles, AI's current and future impacts may similarly lead to a reconfiguration of the workforce, necessitating adaptability and a shift in skill sets.

## So, what's your plan?

We do at least know a little about what's going to happen.  Bainbridge's research about how automating jobs creates more work for humans tells us how to prepare.  We can envision a future where jobs will revolve around monitoring automated systems and making high-level decisions about control, taking ultimate responsibility for outcomes where machines primarily do the work.

We know that automation will shift job requirements, increasing the value of soft skills such as creativity, judgment, and communicationâ€‹â€‹.  We know that leveraging AI will be a critical skill in virtually any job.  AI lives in a world of numbers and is enabled by code, and those are both specific things you can learn.  Software development might not be as common as a full-time job in the future, but working with code will still be a valuable skill.  ChatGPT can answer your math homework for you but it doesn't replace math as a critical skill, because you're still ultimately responsible for solving your problems.  Even if you have an AI coding assistant that understands trigonometry helping you to accomplish it.

So, if you're anxious about what's coming then focus on the things you know will be important.  As either a person or an organization, <mark>develop cabilities related to leveraging and monitoring artificial intelligence</mark>.  And remember that society will be just fine.  We don't know what will happen, but we know there will be a lot of work involved.
