excerpt: In a world with no moats, don't get too invested in any given castle.
---

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Microsoft's dominance in personal computing was unquestioned. The company's operating systems were seen as gateways to the digital world, their mystique unchallenged. Then, Linus Torvalds, a college student with a vision, introduced Linux. This open-source operating system broke the spell, showing that Microsoft’s control was more about perception than technical superiority.

## OpenAI's rise and fall

OpenAI's journey started with a splash, introducing AI models that were not only powerful but also user-friendly. These models, initially free and open, attracted a broad spectrum of developers. OpenAI encouraged deep integration with their models, subtly steering users away from broader industry practices like thorough evaluation of options. As OpenAI progressed, its governance structure - once lauded for its novelty and ethical stance - began to show cracks. The recent upheaval, culminating in Sam Altman's departure, exposed serious governance issues. It was a moment of reckoning, similar to what Microsoft faced in the 90s, but with a twist of irony: Microsoft, once the victim of mystique vaporization, now stood to benefit from the dissolution of OpenAI's aura.

## The 'no moats' revelation

An anonymous Google researcher’s memo, *[We Have No Moat, And Neither Does OpenAI](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither), foresaw this scenario. It argued that the real advancements in AI were happening in the open-source realm, outpacing the efforts of behemoths like Google and OpenAI. The memo pointed out that open-source developers were solving problems faster and with more innovation, effectively "eating the lunch" of the bigger players. In hindsight, this memo was prophetic. Microsoft, which seemed to lag in the AI race, has now arguably surged ahead, leveraging the open-source ethos that the memo championed.

## Implications for the future of AI

The Linux story teaches us that transparency, democratization, and community-driven development can lead to robust, versatile technologies. Applying these principles to AI promises a future where AI models are not tightly controlled by a few, but are a collaborative, evolving tool accessible to all. This open ecosystem could lead to more secure, diverse, and innovative AI applications, much like how Linux transformed the software industry.

## For developers: navigating the future

For developers, this means a shift in approach. Instead of defaulting to the offerings of big companies, it's crucial to invest time in evaluating options for each use case.  It's a critical step in the [AI application development lifecycle](/ai-solutions/) so don't skip it.

Learning to implement AI solutions without over-reliance on giants like OpenAI will be key. This approach not only fosters independence but also encourages a deeper understanding and more innovative use of AI technologies.

## Conclusion

In a world where AI has no moats, clinging to a single AI provider is like investing too much in a castle doomed to obsolescence. AI has already been commodified, and we should approach it as such: interchangeable, replaceable, and constantly evolving. Our strategy must be to continuously seek the next innovation, the next upgrade that surpasses our current tools. This is The Way – not relying on imaginary moats for protection, but embracing the responsibility of perpetual exploration and adaptability in the dynamic realm of AI.
