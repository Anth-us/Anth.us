In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Microsoft's dominance in personal computing was unquestioned. The company's operating systems were seen as gateways to the digital world, their mystique unchallenged. Then, Linus Torvalds, a college student with a vision, introduced Linux. This open-source operating system broke the spell, showing that Microsoft’s control was more about perception than technical superiority.

## OpenAI's illusory mystique

The OpenAI saga, marked by dramatic leadership changes and Microsoft's overnight recruitment of key personnel, has raised serious questions about governance and reliability. Initially, OpenAI's unique governance structure added to its mystique, making it an attractive partner for technology leaders. This allure led many to overlook potential risks of vendor lock-in, as they aligned closely with OpenAI's evolving product suite.

The recent turmoil, however, has cast a shadow of uncertainty. Murati's revelation about the board's stance – that the company's demise would be consistent with its mission – has particularly rattled the tech community. This stance, while aligning with OpenAI's altruistic mission, introduces an element of unpredictability for those relying on OpenAI's services. Technology leaders are now grappling with the fallout, reassessing their dependence on OpenAI amid concerns about its long-term viability and commitment to reliable service delivery.

In an industry where stability and trust are paramount, this episode serves as a cautionary tale. It highlights the need for diversification and a critical examination of governance structures, especially when mission-critical systems are at stake. The swift changes at OpenAI, and the board's controversial statements, have not only dissolved the company's mystique but have also ignited a broader discussion about the future direction of AI development and its implications for the tech industry.

## The 'no moats' revelation

The anonymous Google researcher's memo titled *[We Have No Moat, And Neither Does OpenAI](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither)* foresaw the current volatility in the AI industry. It argued that real innovation was thriving in the open-source realm, outpacing giants like Google and OpenAI. This prediction of the AI landscape’s fluidity, where no single player could maintain dominance, has been borne out in recent events.

Microsoft's recent ascendancy in AI, previously thought to be lagging, mirrors this prediction. The company has leveraged the open-source approach, capitalizing on the rapid changes that have left established players like OpenAI grappling with internal turmoil and loss of trust.

Ironically, this situation echoes Microsoft's own past struggles with mystique and dominance. In the 90s, Microsoft's perceived invulnerability was challenged by the rise of open-source alternatives like Linux. Now, as OpenAI's mystique diminishes amidst governance crises, Microsoft benefits from the shift, underscoring the transient nature of dominance in the tech world and highlighting the need for adaptability and diversification in AI strategies.

## Implications for the future of AI

The Linux story teaches us that transparency, democratization, and community-driven development can lead to robust, versatile technologies. Applying these principles to AI promises a future where AI models are not tightly controlled by a few, but are a collaborative, evolving tool accessible to all. This open ecosystem could lead to more secure, diverse, and innovative AI applications, much like how Linux transformed the software industry.

## How should we respond?

The OpenAI debacle was a wake-up call for everyone who depends on AI to reassess their strategies, not just who they trust.

## As an individual

Our emphasis on prioritizing solutions over tools means continuously exploring and understanding a broad range of AI technologies and approaches. It's about being agile and adaptable, ready to adopt the most effective solutions as the AI landscape evolves.

## Our plan: Commodify AI services

Our initial experience with generative AI via OpenAI was exhilarating. Quickly, their API services became our go-to solution. However, this led us to inadvertently create a dependency, neglecting the importance of constantly evaluating alternatives.

We're a lot more aware now of whether specific tasks require an AI API service or if we could do it better with open-source models and tools like HuggingFace libraries.  If we want to deliver an affordable, secure, and dependable system for some business automation like spotting GDPR forget-me requests in emails then we could use the OpenAI API.  It would be easy and it would work. But why would we want to pay to send thousands of requests to any third party if we could do it ourselves?  Much less a third party like OpenAI that seems conflicted about its own values?

The OpenAI debacle has solidified one of our core values: to commodify AI models and services, treating them as interchangeable tools rather than proprietary solutions. This shift towards a more independent and versatile approach is not merely about cost-savings or information security: It's about staying ahead in a quickly-changing game, where choosing sides among the giants is not the path to stability. In a world with no moats, don't get too invested in any given castle.
